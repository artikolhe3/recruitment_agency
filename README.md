cd recruitment_agency
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build

✅ Now you have a **complete README.md file**. Just save this in your project root and commit it to GitHub — your repo will look polished and recruiter‑friendly.  

Do you want me to also prepare a **short tagline (project description line)** that GitHub will show right under your repo name? That makes your repo stand out even more.
